# Polly

Polly is an [OCaml] binding for the Linux [epoll] system call:

* Small, simple, and self-contained
* Avoids most allocation in the event loop
* MIT licensed

Note that [epoll] is specific to Linux and that this library won't
compile on macOS, for example.

# Other Epoll Bindings

* [OCaml Backpack](https://github.com/jimenezrick/ocaml-backpack/)
* [Jane Street Core](https://github.com/janestreet/core)
